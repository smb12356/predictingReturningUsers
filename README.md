# Business Objective & Motivation:
Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
